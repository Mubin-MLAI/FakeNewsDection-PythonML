<h2>FAKE NEWS DETECTION</h2>

<p>Fake news is one of the biggest scourges in our digitally connected world. That is no exaggeration. It is no longer limited to little squabbles – fake news spreads like wildfire and is impacting millions of people every day.
How do you deal with such a sensitive issue? Millions of articles are being churned out every day on the internet – how do you tell real from fake? It’s not as easy as turning to a simple fact checker. They are typically built on a story-by-story basis
  It’s a prevalent and pressing issue – and hence I invited<u> Mubin Shaikh, Data Scientist</u>. <u>Mubin Shaikh</u> has been working on a project called Fake News Detection that aims to identify and separate truth from fiction. I  approach is based on using machine learning algorithms of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) variety.</p>

<h2>What is this thing?</h2>
<p>This artificial intelligence can predict whether a news article is fake or real based on the words used in the article.</p>
<h2>What do I do?</h2>
<p>Enter a News Content/ Artical in the Search box, the bot will load the article, extract the visible text,
  and use Best AI models to make a prediction of whether the article is fake or real.
  This may take several seconds because the Content / Artical you enter has to be loaded and processed.
  You will get a probability distrobution and a final ruling.</p>
